# Conductor Setup

Initialize or resume Conductor project setup.

## Workflow
1. Read `references/protocol.md` fully before taking actions.
2. Use `references/universal-file-resolution-protocol.md` when resolving project and track documents.
3. Use `references/track-schema.md` for track ID, status marker, and file layout consistency.
4. Follow the protocol sequence exactly, including checkpoint and confirmation gates.
