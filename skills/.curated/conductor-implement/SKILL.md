# Conductor Implement

Execute an implementation plan for a selected Conductor track.

## Workflow
1. Read `references/protocol.md` fully before taking actions.
2. If the user includes a track identifier or scope, prioritize it during track selection.
3. Use `references/universal-file-resolution-protocol.md` for file lookup and verification.
4. Use `references/track-schema.md` for task and phase status/checkpoint consistency.
