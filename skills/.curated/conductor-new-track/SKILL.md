# Conductor New Track

Create and register a new Conductor track with spec and plan artifacts.

## Workflow
1. Read `references/protocol.md` fully before taking actions.
2. If the user includes a description or scope in the request, treat it as the track seed.
3. Use `references/universal-file-resolution-protocol.md` when resolving project and track documents.
4. Use `references/track-schema.md` for track metadata and status conventions.
