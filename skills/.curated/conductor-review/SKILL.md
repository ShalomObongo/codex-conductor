# Conductor Review

Review implementation quality against Conductor plans and standards.

## Workflow
1. Read `references/protocol.md` fully before taking actions.
2. If the user includes a review scope, use it as the initial review target.
3. Use `references/universal-file-resolution-protocol.md` to resolve project and track context.
4. Use `references/track-schema.md` to interpret status markers and completion history.
