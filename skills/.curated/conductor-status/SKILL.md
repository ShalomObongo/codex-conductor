# Conductor Status

Summarize project and track execution status from Conductor artifacts.

## Workflow
1. Read `references/protocol.md` fully before taking actions.
2. Use `references/universal-file-resolution-protocol.md` to locate tracks and plan files.
3. Use `references/track-schema.md` to parse status markers and headings consistently.
4. Produce a concise status report with totals, current work, next action, and blockers.
